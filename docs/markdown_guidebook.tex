\item
  Launch your r/studio app.
  Your rstudio workspace should look more or less similar to this: \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/rstudio_panels.png}
\end{enumerate}

If your rstudio opens up with 4 windows instead of 3, skip next step.\\
2. From the main menu, go to File-\textgreater\textgreater New File-\textgreater\textgreater R Markdown.
You shoukd have a window like this: \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/open_rmd_file.png}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Fill in the details for your document title and author. Leave the rest as default.\\
\item
  Click Ok
\end{enumerate}

This opens up your 4th rstudio window with an rmarkdown script.\\
Now your app area should look more or less like this; \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/rstudio_panels_4.png}\\
The arrangement may however be different. If so, do not worry, it's just semantics.\\
\emph{As you might have seen, you may open other scripts such as R, python, SQL etc in similar manner.}

  \textbf{The Source}\\
  This is your scripting area.\\
  You may write, edit and run your code from here.
\item
  \textbf{The Console}\\
  All processing in r happens here. You may this is the r kitchen.
  When you run your code, this is where it is evaluated.\\
  You may also use the console to write and execute your code. However, you can not save your code, nor can you edit it (you will have to rewrite it). Thus, it is always advisable to write your code in the script/source area.\\
\item
  \textbf{The Environment}\\
  This panel holds your data objects and their metadata. As you create or add new objects into your project, they will appear in this window. You may view and remove objects.
  It also contains the `History' tab from which you may view all your r processing history.\\
\item
  \textbf{The Files/Plots/Packages/Help Panel}\\
  This panel provides a shortcut/alternative to different functions such as to access your project files, to view plots from your code evaluations, install packages and access the Help resource. You may add/remove items here but we will learn that much later. For now we leave it as is.

  From the console;\\
  After the greater than (\textgreater) sign, write command \texttt{install.packages("package\ name")} and hit enter on your keyboard.\\
  See example;\\
  \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/install_rmkdn_consl.png}\\
\item
  In script window\\
  Inside your script write command \texttt{install.packages("package\ name")}\\
  Click on `Run' (Run button is on the top right of your source panel).\\
  Alternatively, if your write your command in a code chunk, you may hit the `Play' button on far right of your code chunk. See example;\\
  \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/install_rmkdn_scrpt.png}
\end{enumerate}

We see more about code chunks in the next chapter.\\
3. From the menu bar\\
From the menu bar, go the the tab `Tools' and select `Install Packages'.

You should see a window like this one \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/install_rmkdn_toolstab.png}

In the `Install from' field, select `Repository (CRAN)', then enter the name(s) of packages to be installed.\\
Leave everything else as default. Click Install.\\
4. From Files/Plots/Packages/Help Panel\\
Click on the `Packages' tab. There are 2 tabs under this, Install \& Update.\\
Click on Install.\\
If the `Install from' is not set to `Repository (CRAN)', set it so, and enter name(s) of packages to be installed.\\
Leave everything else as default. Click Install.

\textbf{Note:} \emph{Packages can only be installed once. To mean, if you close your r/rstudio app and come back to it the next day/session, you do not need to install the packages you already installed in your previous session. You will only need to load their libraries (see next section)}

\hypertarget{loading-libraries}{%
\section{Loading Libraries}\label{loading-libraries}}

To be able to make use of the packages installed, you need to call their libraries. Most libraries take the name of the package. For instance, for the package \texttt{rmakdown}, the respective library is \texttt{rmarkdown}.To call the rmarkdown library, use command \texttt{library(rmarkdown)}.
So in general to load/call libraries use command \texttt{library(name\ of\ library)}.\\
You may load libraries in the console or in your script.

\textbf{Note:} \emph{Unlike packages,library functions expire when you close a project or end a session. Therefore, each time you open an r session, you have to load/call relevant libraries}

\section{About rmarkdown}\label{about-rmarkdown}}

R markdown is a file document that allows you to write, save and execute code, as well as text and figures to help generate reproducible reports that can be shared in several formats.
The file extension is .rmd.\\
A markdown file has three main sections;

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{YAML header}\\
  This is where your document metadata go to e.g your document title, author, date, output file type etc.
  This parameters are set when opening a new .rmd file. And more can be set after.
  This section MUST always be at the beginning of your document and between a set of three dashes i.e three dashes before section and three dashes after section.
\item
  \textbf{Text}\\
  Your narration/prose in markdown format. More details about formatting in subsequent sections.
\item
  \textbf{Code chunk(s)}\\
  They start with ```\{r\}

  and end with ```
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{headers}{%
\subsection{Headers}\label{headers}}

To create headers for your reports/document e.g.~chapters, sub-chapters and so on; use the hash sign `\#' in front of the title. Sequentially increase the number of "\#' signs to denote subsequent header levels.\\
Insert blank line before each header (except in the beginning of document).

\# Header level 1\\
\#\# Header level 2\\
\#\#\# Header level 3\\
\#\#\#\# Header level 4

\emph{Note: For the purpose of this example, I have added a space before each line so that r doesn't create the headers. Remove the space to create the headers}

\hypertarget{bold-and-italic-text}{%
\subsection{Bold and italic text}\label{bold-and-italic-text}}

To create emphasis in your markdown texts, use an asterisk before and after text \emph{to italicize} or double asterisk \textbf{to make your text bold}.\\
Alternatively, you may use single underscore \emph{for italics} or double underscore \textbf{for bold}.

\hypertarget{create-lists}{%

\hypertarget{manual-line-breaks}{%
\subsection{Manual line breaks}\label{manual-line-breaks}}

Use two or more spaces at the end of a line\\
to insert a line break

\hypertarget{insert-links}{%
\subsection{Insert links}\label{insert-links}}

You may insert a link using the plain http address such as \url{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/} or insert it as a linked phrase using square brackets and parenthesis such as \href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/}{our link phrase goes here}.

\hypertarget{insert-figuresimages}{%
\subsection{Insert figures/images}\label{insert-figuresimages}}

To insert images to our document, we use the same syntax as links, but start with an exclamation mark'!' before syntax.
For an image from a url use; \texttt{!{[}text\ to\ accompany\ your\ image\ e.g\ a\ caption{]}(your\ https\ link)}\\
or for an image file in your local directory use, \texttt{{[}your\ image\ text{]}(path\ to\ local\ image\ file)}.\\
For instance, I downloaded the UN Climate logo and saved it as a .jpg in my working directory as exact name \texttt{unfccc\_logo.jpg}
The following syntax will insert the logo into my document:
\texttt{!{[}UN\ Climate\ logo{]}(unfccc\_logo.jpg)}. However, this draws the logo on entire page width. Therefore to specify the drawing width of the image to x inches, we add the the command '\{width=xin\}` at the end. \includegraphics[width=1in,height=\textheight]{unfccc_logo.jpg}

\textbf{When inserting images from local file, it is strongly recommended to have the file in your working directory.}

\hypertarget{insert-block-quotes}{%
\subsection{Insert block quotes}\label{insert-block-quotes}}

To insert a block quote within your text, use the greater than sign `\textgreater{}' in the beginning of quote. The quote must begin on a new line, and remember to insert blank line before and after. For instance;

\begin{quote}
This exercise may seem complicated at first,
but trust me, it is not. You will agree with me sooner than later :)
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{insert-code-chunks}{%
\subsection{Insert code chunks}\label{insert-code-chunks}}

To write your code use open code chunk with three backticks
and the curly brackets \{insert your code language\}, hit enter on your keyboard, insert your code and hit enter, close the code chunk with another three backticks.\\
For code in r language;

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# your code here}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For code in python;

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# your code here}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{create-tables}{%
\subsection{Create tables}\label{create-tables}}

\hypertarget{option-1}{%
\subsubsection{Option 1}\label{option-1}}

Create table headers with dashed lines below the header title. Separate headers with tab or space between the headers and corresponding dashed lines.\\
Type in row values below the dashed lines. The row value length may exceed the dashed line length but MUST not extend into the next header's dashed line.\\
\textbf{Column alignment is based on the position of the header/column title relative to the dashed line below it.}\\
To insert a caption or alt text to your table use, full colon `:' followed by your caption text at the end of the table.\\
Alternatively, use `Table: your caption or text'.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lrcl@{}}
\caption{you may insert table caption here\\
Table: Alternative caption option}\tabularnewline
\toprule
Header 1 & Header 2 & Header 3 & Header 4 \\
\midrule

12343 & 895 & 0.5867891011 & 1 \\
Name & Rank & score & remark \\
Type & 3 & TRUE & 12.1 \\
Left align & Right align & Center & Default \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{option-2}{%
\subsubsection{Option 2}\label{option-2}}

You may also create simple tables using a \texttt{knitr} function called \texttt{kable}.\\
The code below tells r that we want to create a data set with 3 columns, X, Y \& Z, assigning them the values enclosed in the letter c.~The letter c used together with brackets indicates a list of elements. Thus, in the example below, we tell r that our column X, will contain a list of 4 elements i.e 20, 30, 10 \& 50.\\
Then we tell r to create the data set by combining all the columns X, Y \& Z into a data frame.
Finally, we call the function \texttt{kable} and enter the data we created. This function converts or data frame into a table format.\\
Optionally, you may add a caption to the table and specify cell alignment.

\end{Shaded}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:kable}My first simple table with kable}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{c|c|c}
\hline
X & Y & Z\\
\hline

30 & 4.3 & no\\
\hline
10 & 5.9 & true\\
\hline
50 & 2.7 & false\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Note that our code chunk is labelled `kable'. You can label code chunks as in the brackets below}

(open chunk ```\{r your chunk name\}

your code

close code chunk with ```)

This will be useful for cross-referencing.

\hypertarget{page-breaks}{%
\subsection{Page breaks}\label{page-breaks}}

Use three or more asterisks or dashes to insert a page break.\\
\emph{Remember to add a blank line before the asterisks or dashes}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{process-a-markdown-document-to-desired-output}{%
\subsection{Process a markdown document to desired output}\label{process-a-markdown-document-to-desired-output}}

To create the desired output file document from the markdown format, use the function \texttt{render\ ("your\ .rmd\ file\ name)}.\\
Alternatively,and most commonly used, is the \texttt{Knit} button from the markdown script environment. The button is a blue ball of yarn around a crotchet, and is labeled `Knit'
When a document is rendered, rmarkdown saves the results/output file into your working directory, giving it the same name as your .rmd file, but with relevant extension (e.g.~as html if output type was set to html)

\hypertarget{references}{%
\subsection{References}\label{references}}

\hypertarget{citationsbibliography}{%
\subsubsection{Citations/Bibliography}\label{citationsbibliography}}

To add citations to our document, we need to add our reference document details to a text file saved in the .bib format e.g myrefences.bib. We also need to add this file to our bibliography parameter in the yaml section of the index.rmd file.\\
The references for this exercise are saved in the file `book.bib'.\\
To add your reference documents to the .bib file, use the BibTeX citation style i.e

\begin{quote}
\citet{documentype}\{documentname,\\
title=\{document title\},\\
author=\{author name(s)\},\\
year=\{publication year\},\\
publisher=\{publisher name\},\\
url=\{document url\}\\
\}
\end{quote}

Sites such as \href{https://scholar.google.com/}{Google Scholar} have ready to use/ formatted bibliography styles such as BibTeX, EndNote etc. You may copy-paste the BibTeX text into your .bib file in r.

You may have as many documents listed in the .bib file but rmarkdown will only include those that have been referenced within your markdown document.\\
To reference documents in your narrative and thus, have them included in the reference section, use the format \texttt{{[}@documentname{]}}.\\
For instance, \citep{xie2015} and \citep{team2013r} are the only references in my book.bib file.\\
The references will appear at the end of the chapter where they are referenced, as well as in the overall `References' section.

\hypertarget{chapter-references}{%
\subsubsection{Chapter References}\label{chapter-references}}

To reference chapter, type in the chapter title inside square brackets. For instance, this command references our first chapter \protect\hyperlink{prerequisites}{Prerequisites}.\\
The same applies to section headers. Just type {[}section header name{]} e.g \protect\hyperlink{page-breaks}{Page breaks}.

\hypertarget{table-figure-references}{%
\subsubsection{Table \& Figure References}\label{table-figure-references}}

To reference figures use syntax @ref(fig:code chunk label) or @ref(tab:code chunk label) for tables.
For instance, we created our kable table in the code chunk named kable. To reference this table anywhere in our document, just type in command \ref{tab:kable}.\\
This will insert a reference link to table \ref{tab:kable}.

\hypertarget{pandoc-knitr}{%
\subsection{Pandoc \& Knitr}\label{pandoc-knitr}}

\texttt{Pandoc} is a universal document converter designed to convert thousands of markup languages. So when we create our document in markdown and want to output it as a pdf, pandoc does the work.\\
\texttt{Knitr} on the other hand, is an r package that enables the integration of yaml, text and code evaluations into an output document. \texttt{Knitr} contains the \texttt{Knit} function through which we render our rmarkdown documents to our desired output format.
When you render a document in rmarkdown (or call the knit function), the rmarkdown document is converted to a basic markdown language (.md) which is then converted by pandoc to say html, pdf, word, etc as per user specifications.
\texttt{Knitr} and \texttt{pandoc} come in bundled with rmarkdown, and thus, there is no need to install them separately.\\
However, should you need to install pandoc as standalone, you may do so from the \href{http://pandoc.org}{Pandoc homepage}. In this regard, it is important to note that in as much as standalone installations may provide much higher versions of the software than what is already bundled in r, they are often not streamlined for use in r, and may thus cause some compatibility issues.

  Install the bookdown and tinytex packages. Use any of the methods shown in the \protect\hyperlink{installing-packages}{Installing packages} section.\\
\item
  Then from the menu bar go to \texttt{File\textgreater{}-\textgreater{}New\ Project-\textgreater{}\textgreater{}New\ Directory-\textgreater{}\textgreater{}Book\ Project\ using\ bookdown}.\\
  A new window appears\\
  \includegraphics[width=4in,height=\textheight]{tutorial_screenshots/open_bkdown_proj.png}
\item
  Give your bookdown directory a name `NAPBook\_tutorial'. This is the name of a new folder that will be created to store your bookdwon project files.\\
\item
  In the `Create project as subdirectory of' field, use the browse button to navigate to where you want to save your bookdown project folder.\\
\item
  After you select the directory location, you are returned to the `Create Book project\ldots{}' window. Click `create project'.\\
  A new project session opens up, with skeleton chapters and other sections and metadata files. \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/bkdn_proj_window_label.png}\\
  Your project window might appear with panel arrangements different from mine/in screenshot.
  Your project files can be accessed from the Files tab in bottom right of the project window.
  Each chapter is compiled from a single .rmd file, and always starts with a first level header sign `\#'.\\
  From the files pane, you can open any chapter, and edit it to your liking.\\
  Lets take a look at the '\_bookdown.yml' file.\\
\item
  From the `Files' tab, click on the \_bookdown.yml' file.\\
  The file open up in your script/source pane. Notice, the book\_filename takes the name of the folder we created when opening the project.\\
\item
  Let's add the line \texttt{output\_dir:\ "docs"} to this file.
  See screenshot below;\\
  \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/add_docs_to_bkdnyaml.png}
\end{enumerate}

This command creates an additional folder called `docs' and specifies that we want to store our outputs here. This folder is necessary for creating webpages from our book project.\\
9. Save changes. Use the `Save' icon on the script window or Ctrl + S on your keyboard.\\
10. Next, click to open the '\_output.yml' file.\\
11. Let's edit the line that contains the title to our book. Change the text `A Minimal Book \ldots{}' to `NAP Book Tutorial'.\\
Should look like this;
\includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/edit_title_output_yaml.png}\\
Ignore everything else for now :)\\
12. Save.\\
13. Scroll down your files to find the `index.rmd' file. Click to open.\\
14. Edit the title, author \& description fields in the yaml header section.\\
15. Delete all text, except the last code chunk.\\
16. Add a chapter named `Preliminaries' before the code chunk.\\
Chapters are created using the first level header \#.\\
17. Add sections to your chapter using second level header \#\#.\\
Your script shoud look more or less similar to this;
\includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/edit_index.png}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{17}
\tightlist
\item
  Next, open the `README.md' file and edit the text to this `This is an example NAP designed to help you get started with creating your NAPs with bookdown.'. Or add a description of your choice.
\item
  Save your work.\\
\item
  Open the `01-Intro.rmd' file.\\
\item
  Type in the chapter title `Introduction'\\
\item
  Type in sub-chapters with the names `Overview of the NAP Process, NAP Vision, NAP Mandate, NAP Process in Sierra Leone, Functions, Guiding Principles, Goals, Overview of the NAP'\\
  Your script should resemble this;
  \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/intro_chapter.png}
  This text has been borrowed from the Sierra Leone NAP. Use the text from the screenshot below to edit the next two chapters (.rmd files). i.e `02-literature.rmd \& 03-methods.rmd'.\\
  \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/SLeone_NAP_chapters.png}
\end{enumerate}

For the interest of time, let's delete chapters 4 and 5 from our project files.\\
23. From the files tab (bottom right), click on the check-boxes to the left of the application and summary .rmd files to select them.
24. Click delete\\
\includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/delete_4_5.png}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{24}
\tightlist
\item
  Save project.\\
\item
  From the `Environment' window, click on the tab `Build'.\\
\item
  On the new window that opens, click the hammer/Build Book button to start rendering the book. \includegraphics{tutorial_screenshots/build_book.png}\\
  This process may take a few minutes. You can monitor the progress in the Environment window.\\
  When the process is done, your book should open up in an html window as below;
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{27}
\tightlist
\item
  Scroll down your chapters to find the `References' chapter. Oops! No reference! Don't sweat.\\
\item
  Back to our project, from the Files tab in bottom right window, open the file named `book.bib'. This is the text file holding our citations.Currently, only one. You will notice that the document type is a book, and the the book name is `xie2015'.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{29}
\tightlist
\item
  To cite this book in our NAP book, open square brackets and type the `@' sign followed by the book name. i.e \citep{xie2015}.\\
\item
  Let's use this citation say in the Introduction chapter. Open the chapter, and insert the text `Our only citation at the moment is \citep{xie2015}'. See example:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{31}
\tightlist
\item
  Run the `Build Book' command again.\\
\item
  Now you should see that your book has been added to the `References' section, both in the chapter in which you cited it as well as in the overall References Chapter.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  To create additional chapters, create a new /empty .rmd file and save it under your bookdown directory. Use the same numbering structure as the default chapters (i.e.~01,02,03, etc).\\
  We will learn about advanced numbering and re-ordering chapters later.\\
\item
  Use the \texttt{knit} function to render and preview a single chapter.\\
\item
  From our output.yml file, you will notice that we have 3 output options for our file; gitbook, pdf and epub. This is the default. You may select the most preferred output type by deleting the other/unwanted formats or leave this as default and choose a single output format when building the book. Since we left the default 3 options, when we rendered the book, it was compiled in .tex/gitbook, pdf and epub. This can be accessed from the `docs' folder.

\section{Some Troubleshooting}\label{some-troubleshooting}}

Creating pdf documents using LaTeX engines and distributions such as TinyTeX is not a straightforward task and may produce errors as the process involves multiple processing activities. However, most errors can be solved using suggestions contained in the error messages produced in the Environment or Console windows.\\
If, in any case, the LaTeX error generated is not clear, you may use any the commands options below to solve the problem.

\emph{Remove the \# sign to run code}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# remotes::install\_github(\textquotesingle{}yihui/tinytex\textquotesingle{}) \#\# 1 install the development version of tinytex}

\CommentTok{\# update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE) \#3 2 update your r and}
\CommentTok{\# tinytex::tlmgr\_update() \#\# tinytex packages}

\CommentTok{\# tinytex::reinstall\_tinytex()  \#\# 3 reinstall tinytex}

\CommentTok{\# options(tinytex.verbose = TRUE) \#\# 4 set this option in an r code chunk.This helps provide more info on your problems. Remember to remove it after solving your problem}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

See more on \href{https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/}{TinyTex Debugging}.

Additionally, quite often, LaTeX formatting is not very compatible with other output formats such as html. But with the use of \texttt{html\ widgets} and other advanced formatting options, this problem can be overcome.
To produce a pdf document from a document with both LaTeX and html formats, it may be useful to install the package \texttt{webshot} from CRAN.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# install.packages("webshot")  }
\CommentTok{\# webshot::install\_phantomjs() }
\end{Highlighting}
